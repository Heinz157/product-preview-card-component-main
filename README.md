## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned way more about how CSS elements work in tandem and how you can layer css on top of another with @media tags and more specific targeting. It was a long time since I used grid template so it was educational to use that again. I discovered a new html tag today. I thought the strikethrough was done exclusively with css, so it was exciting to see the s tag and implement it.

### Continued development

I would like to work more on this project by maybe redoing it with a CSS framework like tailwind. OR adding a backend implementation like stripe that would actually take you to your cart once the "add to cart" button was pressed. Lots of options to expand on this little component!
